# Maintainer notes

## Challenge repositories

The Code Jam and Kick Start archives are a good place to start. Kick Start 2020+ and Code Jam 2021+ puzzles come with test data in the Analysis tab. Code Jam 2020 definitely doesn't have any, but I don't know about earlier than that. 

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) has many problems with a maths focus, but it can be tricky to sift through them to find appropriate puzzles for code sessions.

## Challenge sources used

Tracking this will hopefully help to avoid reusing puzzles or searching through puzzles that were already deemed unsuitable.

### 2022

Kick Start 2020 rounds A-D, Code Jam 2020 Qualification Round.
