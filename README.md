# stfc-code-jam
Challenges and starter code for STFC's monthly code jam

## Contributing

### I have a challenge suggestion

Create an issue on this repository or post in the #ideas channel on the STFC code jam Slack. Include a link to the challenge you want to suggest.

Good challenges for the monthly code jam have as many of these qualities as possible:
* easy to understand
* achievable within one hour by a pair working together
* can be approached or solved in multiple ways
* don't require complex maths or other niche background knowledge

### I want to write some starter code

Using starter code saves everyone from spending valuable time individually writing the same input/output functions during the code jam. Anyone can write starter code and submit it as a PR to this repository. Please name the script file according to the format `starter-<month>-<day>` and place it in the `starter-code` folder, e.g. `starter-code/starter-April-15.py`.

Starter code should take the input for a challenge and read it into a useful data structure. If the challenge requires output to be in a specific format, the starter code should also provide a function for this. You, as the author of the starter code, can decide what data structures make the most sense for the challenge and your functions.

If the starter code is long or complex, please include comments or type hints to make clear how the code should be used.

The preferred language is Python, as most attendees are familiar with this. Python starter code should be compatible with version 3.7+.
